  <h1>Students</h1>

  <section class="mb-5">
    <p>
      This page is intended to provide some context to potential PhD students on what I am interested in.
      If you believe we may be a good fit, I encourage you to apply to OSU (and include my name as a potential advisor in the application).
    </p>

    <p>
      My primary field of research lies broadly in the intersection of <strong>natural language and AI</strong>.
      Within this space, I am primarily interested in developing and studying
      <strong>human-centered language technologies</strong> — NLP models and systems centered around
      human needs and preferences rather than solely focused on capabilities.
      Please check out my recent publications to learn more.
    </p>

    <h2>If you are interested in joining my lab:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If you are at or accepted to the OSU CSE Ph.D. program:</strong> Please feel free to reach out via email!</li>
      <li><strong>If you are applying to the Ph.D. program:</strong> I will hire through the OSU CSE PhD program — please refer to the department's admission page.
        Select me as a potential advisor on your application and mention my name in your Statement of Purpose.
      </li>
      <li><strong>If you are an accepted MS or undergraduate student at OSU:</strong> Please feel free to reach out via email.
        I expect you to have completed or be familiar with linear algebra (Math 2568), AI (CSE 3521),
        and advanced AI/ML/NLP courses (CSE 5523/5524/5525/5526).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Culture, Values, and Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      I do not expect incoming students to have extensive experience in ML/NLP, but students should be comfortable
      writing Python code and familiar with libraries such as <strong>PyTorch</strong> and
      <strong>HuggingFace Transformers</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will strive to maintain a lab that values inclusiveness and provides a safe, supportive environment for all members.
      As a new professor, I expect to work closely with students, including regular meetings and collaboration on papers and projects.
      Students who value close collaboration are a great fit.
      I do not track work hours or vacation time — students are encouraged to set schedules that support their mental health and productivity.
